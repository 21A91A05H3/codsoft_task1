		<p class="p1"><b>Waterfalls</b> can have a wide range of widths and depths, and this diversity is part of what makes them such a charismatic and interesting natural phenomenon.<br><br>
        Visiting a waterfall is one of the most unique experiences ever. The view of foamy water falling over the rocks and into a pool leaving you in a mist of freshness is something that can only be described when you witness a waterfall for the first time. Fortunately for us, these best waterfalls in the world deliver all of this and more. From the tallest ones that fall from thousands of feet to the ones that offer adventurous hikes, these waterfalls will delight the traveller in you!</p>
        <p class="p1">Waterfalls often form in the upper stages of a river where it flows over different bands of rock. It erodes soft rock more quickly than hard rock and this may lead to the creation of a waterfall.
        Sometimes, the land formation causes a waterfall. If there is a cliff or ledge naturally, rushing river waters will simply fall over the edge.</p>
        <p class="p1">There is no standard way to measure the height or width of a waterfall. No ranking of waterfalls should be assumed because of the heights or widths provided in the list. Many numbers are estimated and measurements may be imprecise. See additional lists of waterfalls by height, flow rate and type.</p>

Around the second week of February, the setting sun hits Horsetail Fall at just the right angle to illuminate the upper reaches of the waterfall. This natural phenomenon is often referred to as the “Firefall“, one of nature’s rarest phenomena.

        <p>The actual waterfall adventure was great - very scenic, quite high jumps and fun slides. I only counted 5 that we went through - 2 jumps and 3 slides (it was early Jan); 2) don't expect any amazing wildlife (when I asked our guide what animals we might see in the jungle, he eventually answered "well, on the left you can see some cows"..) Aside from the adventure, big watch-out: you will have an open bus (no walls, you sit on tight benches under a roof) - so while fun and fresh at first, at some point you almost choke on pollution from cars around you, and also won't hear a word from the guide because of the road noise. <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy aloha, 6/4/2021</p>

         <p>It was an amazing experience, with adrenalin. I loved this activity. The picking up was accurate. The guides were very cool, funny, friendly and informative. We felt fresh and full of energy in the end. The jumps were scary but the guides motivated and encouraged us. The whole trip was fantastic. One thing was just negative: they offer photos and videos, which we can order for 50 dollars. We bought the photos, but they were bad quality, and from the videos our jumps were cutted out or just not recorded.So it doesn't worth to order this service, it's better to take your phone in a waterproof case<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy Naresh, 14/3/2023</p>

On the way to the waterfalls there was a little coffee tasting and a trip to a souvenir shop.
